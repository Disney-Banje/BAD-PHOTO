# What's in this Project

:camera: *BAD-PHOTO* 

This Project is a replica of design that I recently came across on [**BEHANCE**](https://www.behance.net/).
This is the work of both studios and artist, [@Internal Reality](https://www.behance.net/internalreality) & [@M Faathir Fachrozi](https://www.behance.net/mfaathirf) on their latest projects Bad Photography Club 2.

## The Goal of The Project
1. To recreate their images using HTML and Css skills that I have Acquired so far.
2. To create my first repository.
